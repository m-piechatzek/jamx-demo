                            <p>This game is designed to be easily accessible for young children and teachers, therefore it is set up as a website and coded to be responsive on computers, tablets, and mobile devices. The internet is required in order to update scores and students’ progress in the games database.</p>
                            <p>Another note to mention is that audio must be enabled in order for the student to hear the words being read to them from the module.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h5 class="fw-bolder">For Students</h5>
                    <p>Students must be able to use a computer, tablet, or mobile phone or have a caretaker aid them in that process. They will also most likely need headphones or a quiet place, for the auditory portion of the game.</p>
                    <p>Login is required for each student in order for their process to be saved and associated with this specific user. Students progress that is recorded will be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> How long they listened to a certain module,</li>
                        <li> What words they have gotten wrong or right,</li>
                        <li> Scores on the games</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5 class="fw-bolder"> For Teachers</h5>
                    <p>Teachers are expected to use either a computer, tablet, or mobile in order to log in and view student progress and scores.</p>
                    <p> Teachers will be able to see the following about the student:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What students have read so far,</li>
                        <li> If the student has attempted the game, and how many times,</li>
                        <li>Scores from the student</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Teachers will also be able to do the following with the game:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add, update and delete module content</li>
                        <li> Add, update, and delete words and images for the game</li>
                    </ul>
                    <blockquote>
                        Note: Teacher admin abilities such as logins and updates are not yet implemented.

                    <h5 class="fw-bolder">Technology Tools Used</h5>
                    <p>JAM-X is hosted as a static site on the GitHub platform currently but eventually be on the AWS platform in order to use the cloud and enable the use of the backend and the database. </p>
                    <p>It was built using Bootstrap and Javascript for the frontend technologies however moving forward we would switch to React, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL as our full-stack.</p>
                    <p>The game is fairly straightforward to use as a student as well as an admin teacher, however, if there are issues, you are more than welcome to reach out to us via email at jamx(at)gmail(dot)com or send us <a href="feedback.html" class="alert-link" target="_blank">feedback in our form</a>.</p>

                        <a href="https://youtu.be/nYnbapB5Yl8" class="alert-link" target="_blank">Gamification</a> is an educational tool that converts reading from being overwhelming to a fun learning experience for students with <a href="https://youtu.be/zafiGBrFkRM?t=10" class="alert-link" target="_blank">dyslexia</a>. The JAM-X game will be focusing on integrating the learning of the Métis history and terminology into the story plots while also offering opportunities for students to reflect on their own experiences.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="fw-bolder">Collaboration</h5>
                    <p>JAM-X provides the opportunity to make collaborative learning fun by sharing the experiences of gaming. Students will have the opportunity to engage with their peers while playing the game. As peers, they can overcome any challenges together; therefore, building a collaborative environment while improving their reading skills.</p>
                    <h5 class="fw-bolder">Intrinsic Motivation</h5>
                    <p>By integrating the achievement system, students will be motivated to learn. They will be intrinsically motivated to take on tasks within JAM-X to improve their reading skills and feel a sense of accomplishment. As they accomplish a module, they are awarded a medal, therefore converting the learning environment from positive to negative. Gamification strives, at its core, to increase motivation to learn.</p>
                    <h5 class="fw-bolder">Student-Teacher Engagement</h5>
                    <p>Teachers can engage with students by playing the game, demonstrating that they are active participants in their learning process. Also, the teacher can identify when a student is struggling because the administrative side records the student’s progress. Therefore, the teacher will know when scaffolding is needed with a particular student and implement one-on-one sessions. Student-teacher engagement is essential for students with learning disabilities; they need reassurance that they are making progress. By gaming, teachers will provide positive reinforcement and quickly identify learning challenges.</p>
